# Introduction

## The basics

Eaglercraft is Minecraft ported to your browser, developed by lax1dude (and ayunami2000).  
It is now maintained by the community.

There are 3 versions of Eaglercraft: 1.3, 1.5.2 and 1.8.8.  
Below you can see the differences between them:

|    Features    | 1.3 | 1.5.2 | 1.8.8 |
|:---------------|:---:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Singleplayer   |  ✅  |   ✅   |   ❌   |
| Multiplayer    |  🟠  |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| Performance    |  ✅  |   🟠   |   ✅   |
| Full port      |  🟠  |   ✅   |   ❌   |
| Usage          |  ❌  |   🟠   |   ✅   |
| In development |  ❌  |   🟠   |   ✅   |
| Shaders        |  ❌  |   ❌   |   ✅   |

:::caution Use 1.8.8!

It is recommended to use 1.8.8 over both 1.3 and 1.5.2 as it introduces more optimizations and is more actively used and developed.  
However 1.5.2 is also quite common, because it has singleplayer and some of the popular servers are still online.

## History

in 2018 somone by the name of [lax1dude/Calder Young](https://lax1dude.net/) made a game in javascript called [five nights at winstons](https://g.deev.is/fnaw/) (fnaw) which made him wonder: "is it possible to port a game like minecraft to javascript?" so he researched ways to port java into javascript until in 2022 he found something called [teavm](https://teavm.org/) that compiles java bytecode to javascript so he tried porting minecraft beta 1.3 and it was sucsessfull so he decided to put it up for public in github and it didnt really get anyones attention and after some time it got a [dmca complaint from mojang](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/11/2022-11-15-minecraft.md) but he didnt giveup so he made a second version of eaglercraft : "eaglercraft 1.5.2" he put months of his life porting eaglercraft from 1.3 to 1.5.2 and when he was finished after some reconsideration he uploaded it to github but this time he was prepared. he made sure to put hes email in the readme.md so mojang would contact him if they found out about it and want to dmca it. while expoloring on github someone by the name ayunami2000 would stumble across this project and make important contributions like adding voicechat etc. one day from mojang saying that he should delete the repo but before he deleted the repo he made a announcement to the eaglercraft community in the repo's readme.md saying that theis getting deleted and by forking the repo it could be saved and if you didnt know if a repo is deleted after its forked the fork stays but the repo dosnt. after the 1.5.2 repo being deleted and the community suggesting that they should make eaglercraft 1.8.8 so they started working on it but this time they did what any other open-source minecraft client mod does. patching minecraft's code! but mojang still dmca'd it and lax1dude made a [public note for mojang to read ](https://github.com/lax1dude/eaglercraftx-1.8)
